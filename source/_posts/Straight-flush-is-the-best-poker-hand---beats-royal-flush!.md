#  Straight flush is the best poker hand - beats royal flush!

A straight flush is the best poker hand. It is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. This beats a royal flush, which is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit, with the Ace being high.

A straight flush can be made up of any rank and any suit, making it a very strong hand. In fact, it is possible to make a straight flush with all low cards (such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which is called a "wheel".

Interestingly, not many people know that a straight flush is the best possible hand in poker! Most people think that a royal flush is better because it has the Ace high. However, a royal flush can only be made up of 10, J, Q, K and A - whereas any rank and any suit can make up a straight flush.

So if you are playing poker and you are lucky enough to get dealt a straight flush - don't forget to call your friends and let them know that you have the best hand in the game!

#  Wins every time - never loses a hand!

Playing blackjack can be incredibly exciting, but it's also important to make sure you're playing as strategically as possible. That's where the "Never Loses" blackjack strategy comes in - perfect for giving yourself a leg up on the competition!

This strategy is simple: always play blackjack with a never loses betting system. You'll be guaranteed to win every time - no matter what the odds are!

There are a few ways to go about this. One popular method is to bet $10 every time, regardless of the hand you're dealt. If you win, great! If you lose, just double your next bet and keep going.

You can also adjust your betting amounts depending on the hand you're dealt. For example, if you have an ace and a two (A-2), then you should place a $6 bet. If you have an ace and a three (A-3), then place a $8 bet. And so on...

Whichever method you choose, using the "never loses" blackjack strategy will give you a big edge over the competition. So next time you're ready to hit the casino, be sure to try out this winning strategy!

#  The Ace always beats the King!

The ace always beats the king in a card game, right? This might be common knowledge to some, but for those who don't know, the ace is the highest ranking card. The king ranks second-highest and so on down the line.

When it comes to playing cards, the ace is always worth more than the king. In fact, in some card games, such as poker, the ace can even be worth more than two kings! This is because the ace has a higher chance of winning a hand than any other card.

So if you're ever playing cards against someone and they have a king, remember that you can still beat them by playing an ace!

#  How to win at poker - straight flush is the key!

One of the things that makes poker so interesting is that, no matter how many times you play, there’s always the chance that you could win big. With a little bit of luck and some shrewd playing, you could be raking in the chips in no time.

But what’s the best way to win at poker?

Well, according to many experts, the key to winning at poker is getting a straight flush. A straight flush is when you manage to get five consecutive cards of the same suit – for example, all spades or all clubs.

If you can manage to get a straight flush, you’ll automatically win whatever game you’re playing. So it’s essential that you keep an eye out for any potential straight flushes during your game.

In order to maximise your chances of getting a straight flush, you need to play tight and only make sensible moves. You also need to be aware of the other players at the table – if they’re playing recklessly, they might give away their hand and leave themselves vulnerable to a straight flush.

If you can play smart and stay aware of your opponents, there’s no reason why you can’t take home the jackpot at your next poker game!
