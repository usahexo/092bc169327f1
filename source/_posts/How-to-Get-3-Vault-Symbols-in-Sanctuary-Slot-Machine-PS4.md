Sanctuary slot machines are one of the newest attractions on the Las Vegas Strip. Developed by International Game Technology (IGT), these machines gave players a new and unique gaming experience. The symbols in the game offer different rewards, including a chance to win the progressive jackpot.

There are three vault symbols in the Sanctuary machine and they are crucial to winning the progressive jackpot. Precisely how to get them is not well known, but this article will reveal some of the secrets behind these elusive symbols.

The first thing you need to do is find a Sanctuary machine. They can be found at MGM Grand, The Mirage, Monte Carlo, and New York-New York Hotel & Casino. Once you have found one, insert your money and select how many lines you want to play (1-20). Now press “spin” or use the auto-play button to start the game.

The vault symbols are important because they are required to win the progressive jackpot. In order to win it, you must hit all three of them on an active payline. If you don’t have enough money to cover all of the lines, then you will not be able to win the progressive jackpot.

So how do you get these elusive symbols? According to some players, it depends on where the reels stop on each spin. Unfortunately, there is no real pattern or strategy that can guarantee a win. However, by using some common sense and playing smart, you can improve your odds of hitting one or more of these symbols.

First off, make sure you bet on all 20 lines; this gives you the best chance of winning something on every spin. Also, try not to bet too much per spin – $5 per line is a good amount to start with. Lastly, always use the auto-play button; this will help keep your bets consistent and increase your chances of winning something worthwhile.
