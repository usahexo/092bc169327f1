#  The Long and Rich History of Gambling in Las Vegas 

Las Vegas is known for its gambling and casinos. The city has a long and rich history with gambling that started over 100 years ago.

Gambling has been around in Las Vegas since the early 1900s. The first casino in Las Vegas was the Eldorado Club, which opened in 1905. The Club was closed down by the police just a few months later because it was considered to be too risque.

In 1910, gambling was legalized in Nevada and the first casino to open after this was the Northern Club. Gambling continued to grow in popularity in Las Vegas and more casinos started to open up. In 1931, the first Glitter Gulch opened and it became one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas.

The 1930s were a golden era for gambling in Las Vegas and many of the famous casinos that we know today opened during this time period. Some of these casinos include The Venetian, Caesars Palace, The Mirage, and Bellagio.

The 1940s saw the start of World War II and as a result, tourism decreased in Las Vegas. This led to many casinos closing down. Gambling remained legal during this time and some new casinos did open, but they were not as successful as the ones from the 1930s.

The 1950s were a more successful decade for gambling in Las Vegas. This was due, in part, to the emerge of high-roller gamblers who were willing to bet large sums of money. As a result, many luxury casinos were built during this time period including The Flamingo, Desert Inn, and Stardust Resort & Casino.

The 1960s saw another decline in gambling revenue due to increased competition from Atlantic City. As a result, many casinos closed down or were sold. Gambling remained legal during this time and there were some new casinos that opened, but they did not have as much success as the ones from previous decades.

The 1970s saw a resurgence in gambling revenue due to the introduction of new games such as blackjack and poker. This led to many new casinos being built including MGM Grand Hotel & Casino, Caesars Palace 2, and Excalibur Hotel & Casino. 

The 1980s were a relatively stable decade for gambling in Las Vegas with no major changes or controversies taking place. However, there were some new casinos that opened such as Luxor Hotel & Casino and Treasure Island Hotel & Casino.

The 1990s were a tumultuous decade for gambling in Las Vegas with numerous changes taking place. In 1991, gaming tycoon Steve Wynn bought out The Mirage casino and he began to renovate it into what is now known as Wynn Las Vegas Resort & Casino. This led to an increase in luxury hotels and resorts being built in Las Vegas which helped to boost tourism once again.  
Later on in the 1990s, Sheldon Adelson opened up The Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino which became one of the most successful casinos ever built in Las Vegas . It was so successful that Adelson decided to build an even bigger casino called The Palazzo Resort-Hotel-Casino next door which opened its doors in 2009 . 

However , not all of these new resorts were successful . In 2001 , Crown Casino Corporation went bankrupt after building two luxury resorts (the Luxor Tower) on what is now known as “Wynn Land” . 

Towards the end of the 1990s , there was an investigations into links between organized crime bossesand several Las Vegas Casinos . This eventually led to several high-profile arrests including those of mobster Frank Cullottaand Nicky Scarfo Jr . 

In 1999 , then-Nevada governor Kenny Guinn signed a bill that would allow slot machines at racetracks throughout Nevada . This led to a proliferation of slot machines at various locations which resultedin decreased profits for brick-and-mortar casinos located within Clark County (which coversthe majority of Sin City) . 

The 2000s started off with mixed results for gambling lovers . A ballot initiative passed by Nevadans that extended limited gaming hours at bars resultedin drunk people losing money at ATMs outside Strip venues until 6am . 

Then , billionaire Phil Ruffin who already owned Treasure Island hotel purchased New York New York Hotel from MGM Resorts International giving him control over two properties on Strip .

It wasn’t until 1931 that gambling really took off in Las Vegas. That year, the state of Nevada legalized gambling and allowed casino owners to issue liquor licenses.
