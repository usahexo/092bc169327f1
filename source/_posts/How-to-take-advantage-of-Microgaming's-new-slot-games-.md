This developer has been around for over two decades and knows how to create slots that are both exciting and lucrative. In this article, we’re going to take a look at some of the best ways to win big with Microgaming slots.

For example, Thunderstruck II features wilds and multipliers that can boost your winnings by up to 2,500%, while Tomb Raider offers free spins and multipliers up to 15x! So make sure you spin those reels wisely and you could be walking away with a healthy bank balance.
