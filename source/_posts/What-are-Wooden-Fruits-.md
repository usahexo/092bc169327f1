#  How do I play the Wooden fruits game?

This game is based on the ancient Indian game of Pachisi. The aim of the game is to move all four of your pieces around the board, and then home.

There are a number of different ways to play the Wooden fruits game, but the most common is as follows:

1. Choose which colour you want to play as, and then place your pieces in the bottom left-hand corner of the board.

2. Each player takes it in turns to roll the dice. The player with the highest number goes first.

3. move one of your pieces forward that number of spaces on the board, according to the dice roll. If there is an obstacle in the way (a piece belonging to your opponent), then you cannot move past it. You can either jump over other pieces or go round them â€“ whichever is easiest.

4. When you reach the end of the track, you must then take another turn. If you have not yet moved all four pieces off your starting square, you can either move one piece on to the next square, or keep rolling the dice and moving a piece accordingly.

5 Once all four pieces are off your starting square, you can either finish the game by moving one piece home, or keep playing until you lose one of your pieces along the way.
