#  CSKA Moscow Edges Out Competition in Sports Betting

In the wake of the Russian football league scandal, it would be easy to write CSKA Moscow off as a team. However, the club has been quietly going about its business and is now one of the favourites to win the Russian Premier League.

One of the main reasons for their success this season has been their strong performance in betting. CSKA Moscow have been able to consistently win against the odds, which has resulted in them making a significant profit.

This was demonstrated recently when they played Zenit Saint Petersburg. The odds for CSKA Moscow winning were 5/2, but they managed to pull off a 2-0 victory. This was an impressive result, as Zenit are considered to be one of the strongest teams in Russia.

CSKA Moscow have also had success in other competitions. They recently won the Russian Cup by beating FC Rostov 3-1. This was a dominant display by CSKA Moscow, who were able to score three goals in spite of playing against 10 men for most of the match.

Their excellent form can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, they have a very strong squad that is capable of competing against anyone. Secondly, manager Viktor Goncharenko has done an excellent job of getting the best out of his players. Finally, their home ground at VEB Arena is an extremely difficult place for opponents to play at.

Overall, CSKA Moscow are looking like one of the strongest clubs in Russia and look likely to win some major trophies this season.
