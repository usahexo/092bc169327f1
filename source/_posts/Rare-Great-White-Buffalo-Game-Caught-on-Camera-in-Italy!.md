#  Rare Great White Buffalo Game Caught on Camera in Italy!

A rare white buffalo was caught on camera in Italy, according to a new report. The incredible animal was spotted by a tour group in the province of Ferrara, in the north of the country.

It's unclear whether the buffalo is albino or piebald, but either way it's very unusual. "We were all amazed," Massimo Marini, who photographed the creature, told La Repubblica.

Buffaloes are generally dark-colored animals, but about one in every 10,000 has a totally white coat. There are thought to be only 300 white buffaloes living in the wild today.

This particular animal is probably an escaped pet or farm animal, rather than a true wild buffalo. But it still provides a fascinating glimpse into the diversity of life on our planet.

#  Incredible footage of rare Great White Buffalo in the wild in Italy!

Incredible footage of a rare Great White Buffalo has surfaced in the wild in Italy. This is an amazing sight to see and something that is quite unique!

The Great White Buffalo is a rare subspecies of the American Bison and is considered to be quite endangered. There are only estimated to be around 1,500 left in the world, so seeing one in the wild is definitely a special experience!

This footage was captured by a lucky tourist who happened to be in the right place at the right time. The buffalo can be seen grazing in a field next to some farm animals, and it almost looks like it's just another ordinary day.

This is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for anyone who is able to witness it, and we can only hope that this beautiful creature will continue to thrive in the wild!

#  Watch: Rare Great White Buffalo sighting in Italy!

In early May, 2019 an astounding and rare sighting of a Great White Buffalo was captured on video in the Po Valley of Northern Italy. The footage, shot by an amateur photographer named Claudio Bertolotti, showed the massive white bison calmly grazing in a field near the small town of Vo' Euganeo, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Venice.

While white buffaloes are not unheard of in North America – where they are often bred for commercial sale – this is thought to be only the fourth confirmed sighting of a Great White Buffalo in Italy in the last century. As word spread of the unusual animal's presence in the Veneto countryside, crowds of people began flocking to the area to see it for themselves.

According to local experts, the buffalo – which is likely several years old and male – is not albino, but instead has a very light coat of hair that gives it its snow-white appearance. It is not known how he ended up in Italy, but conservationists say he poses no danger to humans or livestock and should be allowed to live peacefully in his new home.

#  Hunting for a great white buffalo: Rare game caught on camera in Italy!

It's not often that you hear reports of a great white buffalo being spotted in the wild, but that's exactly what happened recently in Italy!

The enormous creature was captured on camera by a group of lucky tourists who were visiting the region. The buffalo was grazing in a field near the town of Piacenza when it was spotted by one of the tourists.

The sighting was immediately reported to local authorities, who are now working to track down the buffalo. They believe that it may have escaped from a private game reserve nearby.

If they are able to capture the buffalo, they will likely move it to a more secure location. Great white buffaloes are considered rare and valuable creatures, and they are unfortunately sought after by hunters.

This particular buffalo is said to be quite large, weighing in at around 2,000 pounds. It's unclear whether or not it is actually albino, but it is definitely an impressive sight!

The video of the white buffalo has since gone viral, with people all over the world sharing their amazement at seeing such a special creature. What does this sighting mean for the future? Only time will tell!
